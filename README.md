War!

War is a simple card game that can be played by two or more players. Its objective is to win all the cards in the deck and is named after its own rule for a tie.  It’s called Battle in England, and Tod und Leben (“life and Death”) in Germany. But the German version of the game only uses 32 cards.

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation to make this game.

Getting Started:

<br>
The card images aren't appearing in the html at the moment, but opening the console will allow you to see which cards are being selected in game play. 


Next steps: 
Would be to get the cards to flip over functionally, have the gamer over/win announcement not repeat twice, to reduce the space between the two cards or have them line up on the right and left of the page, and have the final look be a lot more polished. And maybe add sounds and mouse cursor effects.
